a simple application in python for tracking weightloss

The Goal of this application is to make it so that people can take charge of tracking their own food and weightloss privately. I am using the easyGUI library to keep the program simple and linear and as much as possible contain the whole project in one file. At this time the application is more a proof of concept than anything.
