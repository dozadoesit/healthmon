a simple application in python for tracking weightloss

The Goal of this application is to make it so that people can take charge of tracking their own food and weightloss privately. I am using the easyGUI library to keep the program simple and linear and as much as possible contain the whole project in one file. At this time the application is more a proof of concept than anything. 

Coming Soon:
  PineTime Integration: right now I am working on syncing pinetime to the app using itd. It's a work in progress but I have a branch working on this. 
  working on removing CLI stuff in the near future ( right now it's neccesary for debug )
